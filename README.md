# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **[WriteTech](https://writetechhub.org/) Accelerator Program**.

The accelerator program concludes in November. Creating this repository is the first step I am taking to house all the projects I will work on during the program. I will add each project here as I complete it.

Throughout the program, I am working on technical writing projects across API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3, using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a technical writer with a background in engineering and a passion for creating clear, structured, and user-focused documentation. My interests include API documentation, DevOps, automation workflows, and exploring how AI can improve the documentation process. Through the WriteTech Accelerator Program, I aim to expand my skills and build a strong portfolio that reflects my capabilities in modern documentation practices.
