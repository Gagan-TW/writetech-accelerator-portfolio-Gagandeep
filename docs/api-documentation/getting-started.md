Welcome to the Chimoney API documentation. This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up authentication and accessing the core API endpoints to send payments, check wallet balance, and track transactions.

## 1. Authentication

Before using any endpoint, you need to authenticate with your API key.

### Example

Include the following header in your requests:

```

Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_API\_KEY

```

> Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you get from your Chimoney developer dashboard.


## 2. Core API Endpoints

Now that you're authenticated, explore the following APIs:

- [Send Payment API](docs\api-documentation\reference\chimoney\send-payment.api.mdx)
- [Get Wallet Balance API](docs\api-documentation\reference\chimoney\get-wallet-balance.api.mdx)
- [Check Transaction Status API](docs\api-documentation\reference\chimoney\get-transaction-status.api.mdx)

These endpoints help you perform essential operations to integrate Chimoney into your applications.
