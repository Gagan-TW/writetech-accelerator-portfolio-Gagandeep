# Chimoney API (Sandbox) â€“ What & Why

Chimoney is a global payouts platform that lets you move money, airtime & other
value stores across borders with a single RESTful API.

| Key capability        | What it means in practice |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Multi-asset payouts** | Send local currency, airtime, or mobile-money to 30 + countries. |
| **Unified wallet**      | Each test account ships with a pre-funded `USD` and `Mobile Money` wallet. |
| **Per-project API keys**| Generate a dedicated key for every app you buildâ€”keep environments isolated. |
| **Fully-featured Sandbox** | Simulate payments end-to-end without touching real funds. |

> **Why a sandbox first?**  
> Itâ€™s impossible to accidentally charge your card or deliver real airtime.  
> You get **$1 000** test credits in each wallet to experiment freely.
