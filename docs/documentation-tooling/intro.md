# JSONPlaceholder 

## Introduction

JSONPlaceholder is a free, fake REST API that developers can use for testing and prototyping.  
It provides pre-defined resources such as users, posts, comments, albums, photos, and todos.

Instead of building your own backend during development, you can connect to JSONPlaceholder and immediately fetch or post sample data.

## Key Features
- Ready-to-use endpoints for common resources (`/users`, `/posts`, `/comments`, etc.)
- Supports standard REST methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`
- No authentication required
- Free to use with unlimited requests

## When to Use
- Building and testing front-end applications without a backend
- Demonstrating API calls in documentation or tutorials
- Practicing REST API integration
